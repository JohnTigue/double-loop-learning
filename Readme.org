* Double loop learning

[[https://twitter.com/danielbryantuk/status/859172309667643398][A double loop learning diagram variant]] that I saw on Twitter turned me
on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-loop_learning][Double-loop learning]] concept. It dovetails nicely with the
[[https://www.quora.com/Did-Einstein-really-define-insanity-as-doing-the-same-thing-over-and-over-again-and-expecting-different-results][apocrophal Einstein quote]]:

Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.

For what I'm guessing is the original paper on double loop learning, check out Chris Argyris'
article [[http://pds8.egloos.com/pds/200805/20/87/chris_argyris_learning.pdf]["Teaching smart people how to learn" (PDF)]], republished with commentary.

I have coined the terms ‘‘single loop’’ and ‘‘double loop’’ learning
to capture this crucial distinction.

So, the original diagrams were designed for introducing the concept to business types.
The diagram I saw on Twitter was much more of a flowchart for geeks.
This work formalizes the idea into a state machine.
